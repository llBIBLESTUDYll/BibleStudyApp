# Expo CI/CD Usage Instructions

//TESTING THE CI/CD

# Triggering CI/CD
The below guides the user to get the new changes and create a separate app version on AppCenter
## Steps
The CI/CD is set up for the dev branch. There are two possibilities to trigger CI/CD.
- Make the changes directly on the dev branch, commit and push to the repository
- Make the changes on a separate branch and merge them onto the dev branch.
  
ğŸ’¡ Any commits or merges to the "dev" branch will automatically trigger the CI/CD process.

# Monitoring the CI/CD build
The following steps help check the status of the CI/CD process once the code is merged to dev branch.
